<h2>Evoluion of the Frogs</h2>
<h3>The frogs are all brightly colored as a form of warning. The frogs are all extremely poisonous, and so if anything were to eat it they would die.
 However so would the Predator. So the frogs adapted to have bright colors so that predators would know not to eat them to avoid death. The frogs all have 
unique breeding habits. For the most part though the Alpha male of the area calls for a female and they lay eggs in an ideal breeding site. Oophaga Pumilio has
 rather intense quarrels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhjj0NgDhfE">Click Here</a>. As well Oophaga is unique in that they feed their tadpoles unfertilized 
eggs; and if the tadpole needs to be moved the male will carry it on its back. Ranitomeya also carries tadpole on its back. The Species Ranitomeya Imitator has lifelong
 breeding partners and never changes, this is not true for the rest of the frogs, and for most animals at all. However most frogs have a hands off approach to caring for 
their tadpoles. Species such as Ameerega, Phyllobates, and Dendrobates all just lay their eggs in small stagnant pools of water and just wait for the frogs to emerge before leaving. </h3>
